# Amazing Image Gallery 1.6
## Description
Amazing Image Gallery is a small practice project that I did to learn jQuery, JavaScript and GitHub. 

I made it to display some of my Instagram pictures. It displays one 600px main picture and four 150px thumbnails. The main picture changes when the cursor hovers over the thumbnails.

**Updates**

23.9.2015
- Added a navigation feature which enables you to browse through 20 of the most recent Instagram photos from your account. Mouseover on the main photo will show a jQuery tooltip of the Instagram photo's description.

14.9.2015
- Amazing Image Gallery now supports Instagram! You can use AIG to pull four of your latest Instagram pictures from the feed.
