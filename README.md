# Amazing Image Gallery 1.0
## Description
Amazing Image Gallery is a small practice project that I did to learn jQuery, JavaScript and GitHub. 

I made it to display some of my Instagram pictures. It displays one 600px main picture and four 150px thumbnails. The main picture changes when the cursor hovers over the thumbnails.
